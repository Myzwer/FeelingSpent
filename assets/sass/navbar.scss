/*
 * Navbar SCSS
 * ---------------------------
 * This is the scss file to control the styles of the navbar.
 * A few stylelint rules had to be disabled as navbar's merit them
 * Most of the "settings" are at the top, but dig around to change more specific things.
 * Special thanks to https://codepen.io/taniarascia/pen/dYvvYv for the navbar
